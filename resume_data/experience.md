## Projects

### Spoof Detection Model

**Feb 2022 — Feb 2024**

Develop a spoof detection model, using convolutional neural networks (CNN), the model is based on state-of-the-art techniques. The model first created a depth-map for the image and then made inferences on the image and the depth-map.

### Development of a Facial Attribute Detection Model for Mobile and Web

**Oct 2022 — Jul 2023**

Developed a facial attribute detection model that was efficient and small to be implemented on mobile and web using multi-task training techniques. The model made inferences on:

- Occlusions on faces
- Angle of the head
- Use of a hat
- Use of glasses (no glasses, glasses and tinted glasses)
- Whether or not the face was properly lit

### Document Cropping and Alignment Model

**Jul 2024 — Aug 2024**

Developed a recurrent convolutional neural network in order to detect the corners of a document in pictures to crop and align before feeding the output to an OCR system.

### Improvement and Development of OCR Service

**Jul 2023 — Present**

Worked on the data extraction process for documents such as tax status certificates and identifications, additionally developed a new system to extract data directly from the PDF using clustering techniques and graph neural networks (GNN).

### Finetuning for Code Generation LLM

**Mar 2024 — Present**

Worked on finetuning existing code LLM for code generation for a no code platform.

### Sentiment Analysis for Bank of Mexico Minutes

**Aug 2022 — Dec 2022**

Developed a Transformer language model by leveraging an existing pre-trained BERT model and training it with paragraphs from bank of Mexico minutes to make inferences on monetary policy.

### Sentiment Analysis about Feminism on Twitter

**Mar 2022 — Feb 2023**

A research project to measure the change in sentiment about feminism and women's rights in Mexico over the last 10 years on Twitter, using language models.

### Interest Curves Monitor

**Apr 2021 — Jun 2022**

Developed an interactive curves monitor in excel using XLwings. The monitor would bootstrap a curve out bond data and showed relevant markers while allowing the user to change price targets and create theoretical curves.

### Social Volume Monitor

**Jan 2021 — Apr 2021**

Developed a Web Page monitor for tracking the number of tweets and its correlations with the trade volume in the stock market using python. First we would pull tweets using the twitter API then we would use sentiment classification to count bullish and bearish tweets and then show how it contrasts with buy and sell volumes. The idea was to use the sentiment of tweets to supplement incomplete volume data.

### Word Analysis for Bank of Mexico Minutes

**Jun 2022 — Aug 2022**

I developed a python script that would scrape minutes from the bank of Mexico then would stem the words and do a word count for relevant terms while also checking jaccard similarity with previous documents.

### Development and Maintenance of Model to Solve Captchas

**Feb 2022 — Feb 2022**

Trained and maintained 2 models to solve captchas. Additionally, developed a system to monitor their performance.

### Development of a Data Collection Service

**Jan 2024 — Mar 2024**

Developed a service using SQLite and FAST API to collect images that passed an inference from my facial attribute detection model.

### Undergraduate Thesis

**2022**

I wrote my math thesis about an alternative proof to Ramsey's theorem using a modern method known as forcing. Writing my thesis helped me develop critical thinking and allowed me to familiarize myself with reading papers.

### SAT and IMSS Scraping Service

**Jan 2022 — Nov 2024**

Developed and maintained scraping system to download government documents from clients using selenium and BeautifulSoup.

### Implemented State of the Art Paper on Vector Databases

**Jan 2025 — Present**

Implemented "Contextual document embedding" a paper in text retrieval, I implemented the paper to allow me to efficiently search a database of monsters for D&D.

From implementing the paper I learned:

- Gradient caching techniques
- Modern best practices vector databases
- State of the art techniques for contrastive learning
